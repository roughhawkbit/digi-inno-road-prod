# Decision 2: Data Cleaning

## Context
While most data is found to be of good quality, the following errors have been corrected manually:
* In the **MSYH Data Sharing** spreadsheet, on worksheet **Roadmaps&SDRs**, in column **SDR Complete Date** (AO), numerous cells are recorded in the wrong date format (dd/mm/yyyy when the vast majority are in format mm/dd/yyyy)

## Decision
We will manually correct the incorrect values, annotating each cell where this is the case with a Comment saying that the cell has been manually corrected and displaying the original value.


## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
