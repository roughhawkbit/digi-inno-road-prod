# Decision Record

The project uses Michael Nygard's [Documenting Architecture Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) structure as a basis for documenting decisions, adapting this as appropriate (the aim of this project is data science, not delivering a piece of software).
