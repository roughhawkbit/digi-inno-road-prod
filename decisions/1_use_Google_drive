# Decision 1: Use Google Drive storage

## Context
While the data used for this project is not especially sensitive, it was still deemed sensible to store it on university-managed systems and not personal laptops. An attempt was made to connect into the university's Microsoft OneDrive, but this ultimately proved unsuccessful. Connecting to the university's Google Drive proved much more feasible.

## Decision
We will use the university's Google Drive for storage of project data.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
