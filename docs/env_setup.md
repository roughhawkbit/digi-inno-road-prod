# Environment setup

The code in this repository requires installation of [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html#) (e.g., [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main)).

## Using conda

Your terminal should activate the conda base during initialisation. If not, run `source {path_to_conda}/Scripts/activate base`

Then run `conda init`, following any instructions to close and re-open the terminal window, if instructed.

If it's your first time using this repository, run `conda env create -f environment.yml` and accept all Terms of Service, assuming you are happy to do so!

Whenever starting a session running the code, use `conda activate innoprod` first.
